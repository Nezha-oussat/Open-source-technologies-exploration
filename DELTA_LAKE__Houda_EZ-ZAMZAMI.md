### Available connectors / integrations
##### Available connectors 
We are building connectors to bring Delta Lake to popular big-data engines outside Apache Spark (e.g., Apache Hive, Presto) and also to common reporting tools like Microsoft Power BI.
 [See for details.](https://github.com/delta-io/connectors) 
##### integrations
Amazon S3, Apache Spark, Hadoop, Databricks and StreamSets are some of the popular tools that integrate with Delta Lake. 
### Ways to deploy it :
##### Local
It is possible to use Delta Lake locally. It is simply a matter of using the correct version of the Delta library.
##### PaaS / SaaS
Delta Lake is a SaaS software used by many IT professionals.

### Reviews
##### Good Reviews
Delta Lake use in the AWS environment. When the workflow is a little more complex than a simple batch in append or overwrite mode, you have to adopt this technology. The benefits it brings largely cover the costs of this forced marriage. Finally, in order to get only benefits from it, we have to look at the Databricks platform available on AWS.
##### Bad reviews
A Delta Lake table’s performance degradation is likely due to a large problem…
